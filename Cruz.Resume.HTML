		<p><u><strong>Field Trip: Workday Visit</strong></u></p>
		<p>Thanks to my Engineering Academy, I was able to visit
		the company Workday to look at different aspects of
		a physical workspace that concerned user management and design.
		I have two cousins that are beginning to work at Workday 
		this year and I chose to go on this field trip because I wanted to 
		see what exactly took place in a working environment. This field trip 
		had greatly helped me in my college major selection process, since I was debating 
		over choosing majoring in Physics or Computer Science as a major 
		that I would want to choose. After this trip, I began to lean
		more towards choosing computer science, because it would open up opportunities 
		for me to work in a place similar to Workday.</p>

		<p><u><strong>Field Trip: Google Campus</strong></u></p>
		<p>This field trip is one that will remain important to me forever 
		since it served as a great source of motivation for me to work harder in 
		high school and also to show me different parts of the environment in
		Google. I had always wondered what it would be like working at Google, 
		and now that I have committed to UC Santa Cruz, I can have the chance to visit 
		Google more and attempt to network with individuals there. Seeing 
		the different aspects of the Google Campus showed me how vast and beautiful 
		the workspace I had dreamed of could be, and made me want to work at Google even 
		more in the future. </p>

		<p><u><strong>Guest Speaker: James Morehead</strong></u></p>
		<p>One of the most notable guest speakers I listened to was James Morehead. 
		He works at Google as a product manager and most notably worked on a part of 
		Google called "Google Bulletin". This service, Bulletin, allows users to post 
		different kinds of real-life content, similar to Instagram and Snapchat, 
		but have their content globally broadcasted and made very easily accessible to 
		people. He spoke a lot about the process of starting a project like Bulletin at a 
		huge company in Google, and opened my eyes to realize the amount of time and 
		effort managers and developers must put into creating new ideas for people.</p>

	<div id="project">
		<p><u><strong>Guest Speaker: Elyse Chen</strong></u></p>
		<p>Ms. Chen is a researcher from LAM Research who was the first guest speaker I 
		listened to in the 2018-2019 school year. She taught us a lot about how microchips 
		are designed and produced. Her speech went in-depth about the different steps 
		of creating the chips and components of the hardware we use today. I found her 
		speaking to be very interesting because I had always thought about how the motherboards 
		in computers looked so pretty and intricate, and this lecture showed me how those 
		objects of my fascination came to be.</p>

		<p><u><strong>Mentorship Program 2017-2018</strong></u></p>
		<p>In my junior year of high school, I was assigned a mentor to help me in 
		my school life and life proceeding towards a career. His name is Dayne Bratsman. 
		Right now, he is a product manager at Coursehero, and I have learned so much from
		the small amounts of time that we were able to spend with each other. </p>
		<p>He was an amazing mentor. He was a person I was able to speak well to and 
		listened well to everything I said and offered so much solid advice on all of 
		my interests and needs. He taught me to think differently about different aspects 
		of programming and mathematics in school, and also helped me improve the way 
		that I allocate my time outside of school. However, one of my most memorable conversations with him 
		was the way he emphasized the different aspects of prospective employees for a company. 
		In front of me, he compared two resumes of prospective employees. One employee showed a very 
		high GPA in college, while the other showed a less high GPA that had more experience 
		outside the classroom in internships and in pursuit of goals through projects. He helped me 
		reinforce the fact in my mind that I would not just need good grades to succeed, but to apply 
		concepts and information that I have learned to real-world projects. He told me that it was 
		experience that matters the most, and in turn I have now been thinking of ways I can use my 
		skills I have gained in programming and engineering these four years to provide 
		assistance to the less fortunate around me and in preparation for the workplace.</p>
